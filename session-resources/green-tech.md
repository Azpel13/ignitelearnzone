# Becoming a Green Developer

What does it mean to be a 'green' developer? In this session you'll learn some ways that software developers can make their applications a bit more more energy-efficient while also tapping into interesting APIs that help turn our attention to helping build a culture of sustainability worldwide. We'll build a 'Carbon Trigger' extension for Edge together in a hands-on format to help you make good decisions on your electricity usage.
