# Getting started with Machine Learning using Python

You have most likely heard about AI or Machine Learning, but what is it? In this session we will demystify machine learning and build a simple model. We will go over the how to use Python, Jupyter notebooks, Anaconda and commonly used machine learning libraries. You will leave this session with a basic understanding of how to get started building machine learning models with Python.
