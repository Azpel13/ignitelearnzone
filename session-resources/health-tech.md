- [Responsible AI Health Demo - Heart Disease](https://github.com/leestott/ResponsibleAI)
This Demo is to show how using the latest machine learning features in Azure Machine Learning and Microsoft open-source tool kits we can put the responsible AI principles into practice. These tools empower data scientists and developers to understand ML models, protect people and their data, and control the end-to-end ML process. For this demo, we will develop a solution that wishes to detect if a person is suitable for receiving treatment for heart disease or not. We will use a dataset that will help us classify patients that have heart disease from those that doesnâ€™t. Using this example, we will show how to ensure ethical, transparent and accountable use of AI in a medical scenario. Within this repository, you will find all the resources needed to create and simulate a medical scenario using Azure Machine Learning Service with Responsible AI techniques such as: Differential Privacy, FairLearn, InterpretML and DataDrift
